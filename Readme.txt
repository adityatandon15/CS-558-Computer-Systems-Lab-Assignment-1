we have created the code in c++, so stdc++11 is required to run the code.
We run the code in ubuntu(terminal).

To compile the program:
g++ assign1.cpp  (1st code)
g++ -pthread assign2.cpp  (2nd code)
g++ -pthread assign3.cpp  (3rd code)
g++ -pthread assign4.cpp  (4th code)

To run the code. 
./a.out
