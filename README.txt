Threads Implementation in C++.
There are 4 Questions in the given Assignment.pdf and each question is seprately implemented in C++, with the file name as-
assign1.cpp
assign2.cpp
assign3.cpp
assign4.cpp

The file output.txt is the file generated by assign4.cpp and is used by only that file for printing output.

Note-
we have created the code in c++, so stdc++11 is required to run the code.
We've run this code in ubuntu(terminal) but same can be easily done on windows or MacOS.

To compile the program:

g++ assign1.cpp  (1st code)
g++ -pthread assign2.cpp  (2nd code)
g++ -pthread assign3.cpp  (3rd code)
g++ -pthread assign4.cpp  (4th code)

To run the code. 
./a.out
